## Product Management/Product Strategy Examples
This folder contains some example work I have done in customer requirements gathering for the purposes of setting a product roadmap and optimizing product investment decisions.  I have been a product manager, a VP of Product Management and VP of Products where I also managed engineering.  I also was a software engineer and project manager for 5 years at NCR after I received my computer science degree.  I have received the certified SCRUM Product Owner designation from training completed with Mountain Goat Software for the SCRUM Alliance.  

I have always worked on product and strategy through my ownership of product marketing in my prior roles.  I have been Director of Product Marketing and in each organization where I was VP of Marketing or CMO I ran product marketing in a hands on fashion, gathered customer requirements, created content, performed market sizing and segmentation for the purposes of setting the product and company strategy.

Here are a few examples of the breadth of market requirements & strategy work I have done - market requirements documents, customer interviews and product strategy presentations:

## AdPortal 
This company was a self-service ad sales portal sold to Glam Media ultimately. I ran product, engineering and marketing.  We repurposed the software assets of ad network Sportgenics and tuned it into a B2B Ad Sales Portal for excess inventory sales by large publishers.  This product was sold to and ran in production at Time, CBS Interactive and Glam Media among other customers.

Here are some requirements docs:

## SparkPost
SparkPost was a great sucess for me as I worked very hard to find a new go to market strategy for this on-premises only email software provider that was < $20M one time enterprise license revenue when I joined and > $50M ARR when a departed.  I had to figure out why sales had stalled and how we could move into a growing market by building on what we had.  After a pivot to try cross channel messaging with Push and SMS (Twillio does this now), it became clear we needed to be in the cloud first.

This is the simple presentation I used with the board and founder to explain why we needed to transition our product and company strategy to the cloud.  The company was called Message Systems before we became a cloud company (SparkPost).  This shows market sizing, competitive analysis, positioning, analysis of company strengths and weaknesses and a roadmap of incremental market sizes we can capitalize on as we add capabilities.  It definitely was the right decision as we increased company value by several hundred million and we even reached the $50M in 2 years I projected.

He is a more detailed market sizing I did that we used with investors to raise more money.  One of the investor's described it as hte best market sizing he had ever seen :)

Before we became a cloud API, we tried a pivot to add new message channels and become cross channel.  In product management, you need to be able to envision how something could work better but also understand the value of that reengineering or no one will adopt if it is not a sufficiently high ROI.  Here is a presentation I did on new useage scenarios and the value of cross-channel.  Remember, this was 2013 and some of the scenarios in here will look familiar.  They didnt exist at the time.  What I am proud of in here is the original thinking on how to reengineer cusomer engagement processes to make them less expensive and also better for the customer.  In particular, I had come up with what is now commonplace in fraud detection processes - using sms or push to notify the customer and allow them to respond with a Y or N from anywhere as to whether a transaction is fraud or not.  At the time, the banks called you when they suspected fraud.  That process was disruptive to the customer and expensive as each call center call was $12 instead of free.   There were millions to be saved for banks.

## MSCI/Barra - Customer and Product Research Examples
Barra is a data science company who used regression to build multi-factor risk models for asset managers. The company was sold to Morgan Stanley (MSCI) a year+ after I started.  My job as head of marketing became product, strategy and market segment oriented to sort out the investment decisons for the CEO and product roadmap/partnerships. The first step here was to build and run a client consultation process for the company to collect market input from prospects and customers.  I was appointed to the operating committee of the company as a result of this work.  Here are some examples: 

Client Consultation Process (lots of people wanted to know how it would work and how long it would take - here is what I created)

The first question I was asked to answer was a question that went unanswered for years - Should we integrate Barra with the Factset Data Platform? and if so what should the integration be?  There were multiple hypotheses and opinions on what we should do (some related to personal product biases and job security).  But we were losing customers and revenue every year by not fulfilling this requirement.  I'm pleased to say I ran a data-driven approach over a 3 month period and answered the question definitively with our first client consultation project.  We did the integration, stopped the customer cancellations and didn't commoditize our data which was the fear:

Here is the final Factset Presentation to the MSCI Operating Committee:

This set off a lot of demand for more customer knowledge as it's addicting once you get it.  I pretty much worked the next few years determining market requirements from adjacent segments we were not strong in (Hedge Funds, Asset Owners (pensions...)), understanding the requirements of customers for our existing products and what should be turned into a SaaS model vs. left as desktop, what overlaps we had etc..

Here are the questionaires to a number of the studies I developed with the business units and personally conducted the research for:

BarraOne (our failing SaaS product which we turned around once we understood the market) Asset Management Questionaire:

Aegis desktop equity risk product - feature priority customer research questionaire:

Hedge Fund market questionaire:
The hedge fund market was growing rapidly and we were being left out.  Once we understood what they wanted and why they weren't buying us (from this research), we were able to repurpose BarraOne and add features to satisfy the multi-asset class needs of hedge funds.

MSCI Conclusion:
After conducting all of this research, we understood the business well and answered the many product investment questions we had.  We did not have to invest in Aegis to become SaaS as desktop worked better for quant portfolio managers, we positioned BarraOne to be our solution for asset owners and hedge funds who needed internet and muti-asset class coverage and reporting.  And we killed a second very expensive on-premises product called TotalRisk that was similar to BarraOne, moved all of the customers to BarraOne and retained them and saved $10M a year in cost.  It was a complete product roadmap based on data, facts and customer requirements.
