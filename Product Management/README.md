## Product Management/Product Strategy Examples
This folder contains some example work I have done in customer requirements gathering for the purposes of setting a product roadmap and optimizing product investment decisions.  I have been a product manager, a VP of Product Management and VP of Products where I also managed engineering.  I also was a software engineer and project manager for 5 years at NCR after I received my computer science degree.  I have received the certified SCRUM Product Owner designation from training completed with Mountain Goat Software for the SCRUM Alliance.  

I have always worked on product and strategy through my ownership of product marketing in my prior roles.  I have been Director of Product Marketing and in each organization where I was VP of Marketing or CMO I ran product marketing in a hands on fashion, gathered customer requirements, created content, performed market sizing and segmentation for the purposes of setting the product and company strategy.

Here are a few examples of the breadth of market requirements & strategy work I have done - market requirements documents, customer interviews and product strategy presentations:

## AdPortal 
This company was a self-service ad sales portal sold to Glam Media ultimately. I ran product, engineering and marketing.  We repurposed the software assets of ad network Sportgenics and tuned it into a B2B Ad Sales Portal for excess inventory sales by large publishers.  This product was sold to and ran in production at Time, CBS Interactive and Glam Media among other customers.

Here are some requirements docs:

## SparkPost
SparkPost was a great sucess for me as I worked very hard to find a new go to market strategy for this on-premises only email software provider that was < $20M one time enterprise license revenue when I joined and > $50M ARR when a departed.  I had to figure out why sales had stalled and how we could move into a growing market by building on what we had.  After a pivot to try cross channel messaging with Push and SMS (Twillio does this now), it became clear we needed to be in the cloud first.

This is the simple presentation I used with the board and founder to explain why we needed to transition our product and company strategy to the cloud.  The company was called Message Systems before we became a cloud company (SparkPost).  This shows market sizing, competitive analysis, positioning, analysis of company strengths and weaknesses and a roadmap of incremental market sizes we can capitalize on as we add capabilities.  It definitely was the right decision as we increased company value by several hundred million and we even reached the $50M in 2 years I projected.

He is a more detailed market sizing I did that we used with investors to raise more money.  One of the investor's described it as hte best market sizing he had ever seen :)

Before we went cloud we tried a pivot to add new message channels and become cross channel.  In product, you need to be able to envision how something could work better but also understand the value of it.  I think this was an internal presentation I did for the president/Founder (George).  This was 2013.  What I am proud of in here is the original thinking on how to reengineer cusomer engagement processes to make them less expensive and also better for the customer.  In particular, I had come up with what is now commonplace in fraud detection processes - using sms or push to notify the customer and allow them to respond with a Y or N from anywhere as to whether a transaction is frud or not.  At the time, the banks called you, the process was disruptive to the customer and expensive as each call center call was $12 instead of free.   There were millions ot be saved for banks.

## MSCI/Barra - Customer Research Examples
Barra is a data science company who used regression to build multi-factor risk models for asset managers. The company was sold to Morgan Stanley a year after I started.  My job as head of marketing became product, startegy and market segment oriented to sort out the investment decisons for the CEO and product roadmap/partnerships. The first step here was to build and run a client consultation process for the company to collect market input from prospects and customers.  I was appointed to the operating committee of the company as a result of this work.  Here are some examples: 

Client Consultation Process (lots of people wanted to know how it would work and how long it would take)

The first question I was asked to answer was a question that went unanswered for years - Should we integrate Barra with the Factset Data Platform and if so what should the integration be?  There were multiple hypothesis and opinions on what we should do.  But we were losing customers and revenue every year by not fulfilling this requirement.  Im pleased to say I ran a data-driven approach over a 3 month period and answered the question definitively with our first client consultation:

Here is a presentation on how customers used our different risk analytics products for the purposes of setting our produt strategy.  I was given this assignment by the CEO and reported this data to the operating committee.  This was important so we knew which products to invest in, which needed to move to the cloud vs. stay as desktop products, which products to target at which segments (pension plans, hedge funds, quant portfolio managers), and which products had overlap that we might discontinue (which we did to save $10M a year).
