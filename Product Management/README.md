This folder contains some example work I have done in customer requirements gathering for the purposes of setting a product roadmap and optimizing product investment decisions.  I have been a product manager, a VP of Product Management and VP of Products where I also managed engineering.  I also was a software engineer and project manager for 5 years at NCR after I received my computer science degree.  In addition, I have received the certified SCRUM Product Owner designation from training completed with Mountain Goat Software for the SCRUM Alliance.  

But even in my B2B software marketing roles, I have always worked on product and strategy.  I have been Director of Product Marketing and in each organization where I was VP of Marketing or CMO I ran product marketing in a hands on fashion, gathered customer requirements, created content, performed market sizing and segmentation for the purposes of setting the product and company strategy.

Here are a few examples of requirements documents I wrote and other market requirements and product strategy presentations:

# AdPortal 
This company was a self-service ad sales application sold to Glam Media ultimately. We repurposed the software assets of ad network Sportgenics and tuned it into a B2B Ad Sales Portal for excess inventory sales by large publishers.  This product was sold to and ran in production at Time, CBS Interactive and Glam Media among other customers.

# SparkPost
This is the simple presentation I used with the board and founder to explain why we needed to transition our product and company the cloud.  The company was called Message Systems before we became a cloud company (SparkPost)

# MSCI/Barra
Here is a presentation on how customers used our different risk analytics products for the purposes of setting our produt strategy.  I was given this assignment by the CEO and reported this data to the operating committee.  This was important so we knew which products to invest in, which needed to move to the cloud vs. stay as desktop products, which products to target at which segments (pension plans, hedge funds, quant portfolio managers), and which products had overlap that we might discontinue (which we did to save $10M a year).
