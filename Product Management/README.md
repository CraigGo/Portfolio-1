This folder contains some example work I have done in customer requirements gathering for the purposes of setting the product roadmap and optimizing product investment decisions.  I have been a product manager, a VP of Prouct Management and VP of Products where I also managed engineering.  

Here are a few examples:

AdPortal - a Self Service ad sales platform sold to Glam Media ultimately. We repurposed the ad network Sportgenics software and turned it into a B2B Ad Sales Portal for excess inventory.  This product was sold to and ran in production at Time, CBS Interactive and Glam Media among other customers.
