    "Weekends are a time when visitors to the bay area and locals alike are interested in leisurly exploring the city without the hurried pace of the work week. Using a bicyle to move about is and interesting and cost effective means of transportation. Research has also shown that weekends are a prime time for catching up on exercise providing an additional incentive to ride. Given weekend trip volumes are approximately 25-30% of weekday trips, Ford Bikes can afford to offer additional free hours of bicycle usage with paid hours which will increase revenue overall while incenting customers to utilize our open weekend bikes.  We propose two promotion ideas through the mobile app.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For non-subscriber customers who occasionally make use of bikes on day passes or per trip passes, we can offer on weekend days: \"2 hours for \\$5\".  This will allow riders to take a ride to the bridge or ride to breakfast, eat and \n",
    "return home for a flat \\$5 fee which could not have been accomplished with our normal 30 minute trip limit pricing without overage charges. Overages beyond 2 hours are simply charged at the normal \\$3 per 15 minute \n",
    "rate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand cannibalization risk, we recognize from the data above, that the majority of weekend trips (343) are made by subscribers who would pay Ford nothing additional anyway.  On average 310 trips are made on weekend days with an average duration of 55 minutes before bike check in. We don't know how many of these trips were made by day pass buyers who paid \\$10 vs. single riders who would have paid \\$8 for this amount of time. It seems likely, that given how close the average time is to one hour where additional minutes would exceed the cost of a day pass, that most trips are on a day pass. Therefore, we believe that the \\$5 for 2 hour offer will incent new trial ridership without cannibilizing the \\$10 day pass revenue we currently recognize.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For new customers, we can offer \"Bike it Off\" a way to promote using a bike for exercise on the weekend. This promo has identical terms to \"2 Hours for $5\", but in addition to selling unused capacity, we are attempting to allow customers of this offer to sample what it is like to use our bikes, with the hope that they will become a more regular customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mobile app will allow us to distinguish these offers for the two segments of customers.\n",
