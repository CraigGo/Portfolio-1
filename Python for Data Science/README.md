Python for Data Science

My project 1 implementation of Battleship was selected to be in the MIDS Python Showcase in Fall 2019 for Object-Oriented design of a Python program. I think this is a good example of how I cleanly write and document code.  I built this in Jupyter, but it runs better in terminal as a .py file as the window is bigger for the full screen.

My project 2 was with a team of 4 and we analyzed Yelp data to determine if Yelp reviews matter.  This was really more of a Pandas exercise in graphing and charting our data, but we definitely did some coding as well in assembling dataframes with Python.  The PDF is published in the repository.

In the class we also covered:  

- Python syntax and data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples..)
- Libraries, modules
- Command line  
- Jupyter notebooks 
- Pandas  
- Numpy 
- Object-Oriented programming vs. functional programming
- Lamda functions, Regex
