Python for Data Science

My project 1 implementation of Battleship was selected to be in the MIDS Python Showcase in Fall 2019 for Object-Oriented design of a Python program. I think this is a good example of how I cleanly write and document code.  I built this in Jupyter, but it runs better in terminal as a .py file as the window is bigger for the full screen.
