Here are a few examples of recent projects in the product marketing area:

Qubole Corporate video used in emailings, self-running trade show booth presentations (that is why there are sub-titles in this version) and lunch rountable presentations as a kickoff.

Qubole - AWS Reinvent Booth presentation I created to highlight their activities at the show and most importantly the customers and ROI by industry.

Here is an ROI analysis I created about the impact of their workload aware autoscaling.  This was done by comparing the costs of Qubole vs. the plain costs of AWS without using Qubole as we had the amount of resources consumed to compare.
