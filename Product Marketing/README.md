My technical data management/data science knowledge, customer facing skills and go to market brain have always made me a standout product marketer and product manager in designing features and product roadmaps.  Here are a few examples of recent projects in the product marketing area:

Qubole - This is the Qubole corporate video I created for them to tell their story.  It was used in emailings, self-running trade show booth presentations (that is why there are sub-titles here as booths are loud ) and lunch rountable presentations as a kickoff.

Qubole - This is the AWS Reinvent booth presentation I created to highlight their activities at the show and most importantly the customers and cost savings by industry.

Qubole - Here is an ROI analysis I created about the impact of their workload aware autoscaling.  This was done by comparing the costs of Qubole vs. the plain costs of AWS without using Qubole as we had the amount of resources consumed to compare.

Qubole - Here is a white paper I authored for them for the Snowflake/Qubole partnership launch.  It discusses big data object store platforms like Qubole and S3 and how they are different than RDBMS data warehouses (like Snowflake) and offers models for how to itegrate the two into a modern data architecture for structured and unstructured data.
